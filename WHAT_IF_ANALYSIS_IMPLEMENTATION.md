# What-If Analysis Feature Implementation

## ðŸ“Š Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive What-If analysis feature for the Trading Diary application that allows traders to simulate different trading scenarios and identify opportunities for improvement.

## ðŸš€ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced What-If Calculations (`/frontend/src/utils/whatIfCalculations.ts`)
- **12 Advanced Scenarios** (expanded from 6):
  - Better Entry Timing (5% improvement)
  - Better Exit Timing (5% improvement)  
  - Proper Position Sizing (2% risk per trade)
  - Winning Setups Only (filter losing trades)
  - Tighter Stop Losses (20% reduction)
  - Position Scaling (50% at target)
  - **NEW**: Optimal Stop Loss (data-driven)
  - **NEW**: Remove Worst 10% (avoid bad trades)
  - **NEW**: Best Trading Days Only
  - **NEW**: Trailing Stop Loss implementation
  - **NEW**: Risk-Reward Filter (1:2+ only)
  - **NEW**: Market Condition Filter (avoid volatility)

- **Sophisticated Algorithms**:
  - Statistical analysis for optimal stop loss placement
  - Volatility-based market condition filtering
  - Daily performance correlation analysis
  - Advanced trailing stop calculations
